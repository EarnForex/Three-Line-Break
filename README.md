# Three-Line Break

Three-Line Break is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. You can use it to display a line break chart in your MetaTrader platform.

After attaching this indicator to a chart, it is best to switch the original chart's type to _Line_ and its color to _None_. This will get you a clear three-line break chart display.
